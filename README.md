### Data Collection
- Gathering historical statistical data from the Premier League era (1992-present).
- Analyzing social media sentiments and expert opinions to gauge player performance expectations.
- Incorporating fixture difficulty ratings and home/away match factors into the prediction model.

### Prediction Algorithms
- Statistical model: Utilizes past player performances and match statistics to forecast future performances.
- Social media model: Analyzes user sentiments and expert opinions from platforms like Twitter to assess player popularity and potential.
- Variable model: Considers external factors such as injuries, managerial decisions, and fixture difficulty ratings to refine predictions.

### User Interaction
